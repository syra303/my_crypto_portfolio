Annualized Return on Investment (ROI)
The annualized ROI calculation provides a solution for one of the key limitations of the basic ROI calculation; the basic ROI calculation does not take into account the length of time that an investment is held, also referred to as the holding period. The formula for calculating annualized ROI is as follows:

Annualized ROI=[(1+ROI) 
1/n
 −1]×100%
where:
n= 
​
  
Number of years for which the investment
is held
​
 
​
This calculation can also be used for holding periods of less than a year by converting the holding period to a fraction of a year.

Assume an investment that generated an ROI of 10% over six months.

\text{Annualized ROI}=[(1+0.10)^{1/0.5}-1]\times100\%=21.00\%Annualized ROI=[(1+0.10) 
1/0.5
 −1]×100%=21.00%
﻿

In the equation above, the numeral 0.5 years is equivalent to six months.
